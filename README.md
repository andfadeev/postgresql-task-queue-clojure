In PostgreSQL, `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` is used to implement concurrent access to rows in a table while ensuring that no two transactions process the same row simultaneously. It is especially useful in scenarios where you have multiple workers or processes trying to handle tasks in a queue, and you want to prevent them from working on the same tasks at the same time.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the query:

### `SELECT FOR UPDATE`
- **`FOR UPDATE`**: This clause locks the selected rows so that no other transaction can modify or lock them until the current transaction is completed. The rows remain locked until the transaction commits or rolls back.
- When rows are locked by `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, other transactions are blocked if they try to modify or lock those same rows.

### `SKIP LOCKED`
- **`SKIP LOCKED`**: This option allows the query to skip any rows that are already locked by another transaction. Instead of waiting for the lock to be released (which would normally happen), the query ignores those locked rows and moves on to other available rows.
- This is useful when you're working in a high-concurrency environment and don't want your process to be blocked while waiting for other transactions to release their locks.

### Typical Use Case
The `SKIP LOCKED` feature is often used in task queue processing. When multiple workers are trying to fetch and process tasks from a shared task queue (i.e., a table of tasks), they use `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` to lock and fetch tasks without stepping on each other's toes.

### Example

Imagine you have a table `tasks` that stores tasks to be processed by multiple workers:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    task_name text,
    status text
);
```

You can use the following query to let each worker select and lock an available task:

```sql
BEGIN;

SELECT id, task_name
FROM tasks
WHERE status = 'pending'
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
LIMIT 1;

-- Perform task processing here

UPDATE tasks
SET status = 'completed'
WHERE id = <id from the SELECT>;

COMMIT;
```

In this example:
- The query selects one row (`LIMIT 1`) where `status = 'pending'`, locks it (`FOR UPDATE`), and skips over any tasks that are already locked by other workers (`SKIP LOCKED`).
- Once the task is locked, the worker processes it and marks it as `completed` by updating the `status`.

### Advantages
- **Avoid Deadlocks**: By skipping locked rows, you avoid potential deadlocks or long waits caused by other transactions holding locks.
- **Efficient Task Processing**: Each worker can pick up tasks quickly without waiting for other workers to finish.

In short, `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` is a powerful tool for efficient, concurrent task processing in PostgreSQL.
